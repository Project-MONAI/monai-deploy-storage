# MONAI Deploy Storage

The MONAI Deploy Storage library for MONAI Deploy clinical data pipelines system enables users to extend the system to external storage services by implementing the [IStorageService API](src/Storage/API/IStorageService.cs).  The API allows users to plug in any other storage services, such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/) and [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/).

Currently supported storage services:

- [MinIO](https://min.io/)*

\* Services provided may not be free or requires special license agreements.  Please refer to the service providers' website for additional terms and conditions.

If you would like to use a storage service provider not listed above, please file an [issue](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-storage/issues) and contribute to the repository.
