# MONAI Deploy Storage

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-storage/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=a7lu3x6kEo)](https://codecov.io/gh/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-storage)

[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Monai.Deploy.Storage?label=NuGet%20Download)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Monai.Deploy.Storage/)

The MONAI Deploy Storage library for MONAI Deploy clinical data pipelines system enables users to extend the system to external storage services by implementing the [IStorageService API](src/Storage/API/IStorageService.cs), which allows the users to plug in any other storage services, such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/) and [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/).

Currently supported storage services:

- [MinIO](./src/Plugins//MinIO/)*
- [Amazon S3](./src/Plugins/AWSS3/)

\* Services provided may not be free or requires special license agreements. Please refer to the service providers' website for additional terms and conditions.

If you would like to use a storage service provider not listed above, please file an [issue](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-storage/issues) and contribute to the repository.

## Installation

### 1. Configure the Service
To use the MONAI Deploy Storage library, install the [NuGet.Org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Monai.Deploy.Storage/) package and call the `AddMonaiDeployStorageService(...)` method to register the dependencies:

```csharp

Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        ...
        services.AddMonaiDeployStorageService(hostContext.Configuration.GetSection("InformaticsGateway:storage:serviceAssemblyName").Value);
        ...
    });
```

### 2. Install the Plug-in

1. Create a subdirectory named `plug-ins` in the directory where your main application is installed.
2. Download the zipped plug-in of your choice and extract the files to the `plug-ins` directory.
3. Update `appsettings.json` and set the `serviceAssemblyName`, e.g.:  
   ```json
    "storage": {
      "serviceAssemblyName": "Monai.Deploy.Storage.MinIo.MinIoStorageService, Monai.Deploy.Storage.MinIO"
    }
   ```

### 3. Restrict Access to the Plug-ins Directory

To avoid tampering of the plug-ins, it is recommended to set access rights to the plug-ins directory.

NuGet packages are available on both [NuGet.Org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Monai.Deploy.Storage/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-storage/packages/1350678). Zip files may be found in the build artifacts or the [Releases](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-storage/releases) section.

### Official Builds

Official releases are built and released from the `main` branch.

### RC Builds

Release candidates are built and released from the `release/*` branches.

### Development Builds

Development builds are made from all branches except the `main` branch and the `release/*` branches. The NuGet packages are released to [GitHub](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy-storage/packages/1350678) only.

## Contributing

For guidance on contributing to MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager, see the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-deploy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Writing Your Plug-in

To extend MONAI Deploy with your custom storage service provider, you must implement the [IStorageService](./src/Storage/API/IStorageService.cs) interface and extend the [ServiceRegistrationBase](./src/Storage/ServiceRegistrationBase.cs) base class.

* The **IStorageService** interface provides a set of methods required to interact with the storage layer.
* The **ServiceRegistrationBase** base class provides an abstract method _Configure()_ to configure service dependencies based on [.NET Dependency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection). The derived instance is dynamically activated during runtime based on the *ServiceAssemblyName* value defined in the [StorageServiceConfiguration](./src/Storage/Configuration/StorageServiceConfiguration.cs).
